# problems
i am not sure if it was my laptop or what but every time i had an issue with displaying images or the registering bit, i will contact a tutor or mentor to give me advise, but when they had alook it was fine they did not get the same problem i had, which then made it frustrating to test as i could not figure out what was going on, same thing the facebook and googel log in i kept getting the error but when the tutor did it there was no problem.

# persnal issues
the reason I used the same style as the boutiq ado progect is because i had some personal problems and financil issues that made ir very hard to complete the proyect and create something new. then time was running out and i had to do with what i had . i am really sorry i know this is not what you look in students.


## Deployment
the code is stored in git hub and deplyed in heroku, i will go the heroku page and press deploy code this will manually deply the updates and the website to heroku. i will run the comands gid add . , git commit -m "", git push to push the code to git hub once that is done i will go to heroku and click on deply branch.
